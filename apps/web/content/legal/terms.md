**Cancellations:** You can cancel your ExamAce Pro Yearly Membership at any time but this will not result in a refund. If you purchase a subscription that automatically renews, you may cancel the subscription any time before the end of the current billing period, and the cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing period.
